# DecisionTree

-Implemented decision trees from scratch
-Implemented random forest classification with decision trees from scratch.
-Applied both the machine learning classification techniques to mushroom data set and poker data set to compare the efficiency of each of the algorithms ,varying the number of decision trees in random forests
-Built the visualization of the decision tree to have a visual look at the model to understand the data better
